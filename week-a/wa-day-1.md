# Instructions

## Task 1

Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console. The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code. Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below.

Output:

```bash
1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
3. Add 3g of Salt.
4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.
```

Day 1 - String Manipulation")
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
```

## Task 3

Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name. Your code should only output the number, no other text is needed.

### Hint
Remember, you can use `len()` around any piece of text to calculate the number of characters.

e.g. 
```python
url = "https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow"

# Important
# Add prompt text to the input() function.

#e.g. use

✅ url = input()

don't use:

❌ url = input("What's the url?")
```

## Task 4 - Optional

Write a program that print any input name. Your code should work for any name. Your code should output Hello, followed by the name.

### Example Input

```bash
John
```

### Example Output

```bash
